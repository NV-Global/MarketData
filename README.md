# MarketData: Real-Time Fractured-Feed Ingestion for Risk Surveillance and Insights

![Release badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/MarketData-Releases-brightgreen?style=for-the-badge)

MarketData is a fracture-feed ingestion framework built to power real-time risk surveillance and tick-level insight optimization with historical data replay. It focuses on low latency, high throughput, and fault tolerance. It supports replay of historical sessions to validate strategies, test risk models, and verify system behavior under varied market conditions.

The goal is to enable teams to ingest, process, and analyze market data at tick level in real time while maintaining the ability to go back in time for backtesting and verification. It is designed to be modular, extensible, and container-friendly so teams can tailor it to their data sources, processing logic, and delivery targets.

Overview
MarketData aims to give risk teams and research desks a reliable, scalable platform for ingesting market data in real time. It also provides tools to extract insights at tick granularity. A key feature is the historical data replay capability, which lets you recreate past market sessions to test strategies, validate risk models, or demonstrate system behavior under known conditions. The framework is designed to be adaptable to multiple data sources, event streams, and downstream destinations, such as risk engines, dashboards, and archival stores.

This README uses plain language to describe what MarketData does, how it is structured, and how you can get started. It is written to guide engineers, data scientists, risk managers, and operators through setup, configuration, and day-to-day usage. It assumes a basic familiarity with data pipelines, streaming data, and software deployment in modern cloud or on-prem environments.

Core Concepts
- Fractured Feed: A feed broken into distinct streams that can be ingested independently. Fractured feeds help handle bursty or out-of-order data more gracefully.
- Tick-Level Insight: The ability to analyze each market event as soon as it arrives. This enables precise risk signals and fast decision making.
- Ingestion Pipeline: The path data takes from source to processing. It includes source adapters, buffering, rate limiting, and error handling.
- Historical Replay: A controlled mechanism to replay past market data. This supports backtesting, model validation, and scenario analysis.
- Real-Time Risk Surveillance: Monitors that track risk metrics as data flows through the system. It highlights anomalies and stress conditions as they occur.
- Insight Optimizer: A set of rules and models that extract actionable signals from tick data. It prioritizes insights based on risk impact and latency requirements.
- Modularity: Components are designed to be swapped or extended without rewriting the whole system.
- Observability: Metrics, logs, and traces give operators visibility into the health and performance of the pipeline.

Architecture and Design
MarketData is built as a modular, service-oriented system. Each module focuses on a single responsibility and communicates with others through well-defined interfaces. The architecture emphasizes isolation of concerns, clear data contracts, and robust error handling. Below is a high-level view of the main components and how they interact.

- Ingestion Layer
  - Source Adapters: Handshake with data providers, normalize formats, and emit standardized events.
  - Fractured Queues: Per-data-stream queues that decouple producers from consumers and provide backpressure handling.
  - Normalizers and Enrichers: Attach metadata (production time, source, data quality flags) to events.

- Processing Layer
  - Real-Time Engine: Applies risk calculations, filters, and feature extraction on the fly.
  - Tick Aggregation: Bins and reduces data when appropriate while preserving per-tick fidelity for downstream consumers.
  - Anomaly and Quality Guards: Detects outliers, missing data, and late events, and triggers corrective actions.

- Historical Replay Layer
  - Replay Controller: Coordinates playback speed, backfills gaps, and ensures deterministic reproduction of events.
  - Time Travel Window: Lets users select a time range for replay and specify the fidelity of replay (exact vs. approximate).

- Output Layer
  - Risk Signals: Exposed through streams or APIs for downstream risk engines and dashboards.
  - Stored Snapshots: Periodic or event-driven snapshots for auditing and analytics.
  - Auditable Logs: Immutable records for compliance and traceability.

- Observability and Control Plane
  - Metrics: Throughput, latency, data quality, error rates, and backlog levels.
  - Logs: Structured logs with correlation IDs across components.
  - Tracing: End-to-end traces for latency debugging.

- Data Plane and Storage
  - Storage Layer: Time-series or event-based storage for historical replay and long-term analysis.
  - Compression and Retention: Policies to manage storage usage and data lifecycle.

- Deployment and Orchestration
  - Containerized Services: Each module can run as a container.
  - Orchestration: Kubernetes or similar systems for scaling, self-healing, and rolling updates.
  - Local Development: Docker Compose or similar tools for rapid development and testing.

Data Model
Market Data events are structured to carry essential market and venue context, along with reliability and quality metadata. A typical event includes:

- event_time: The primary timestamp of the market event (ISO 8601).
- source: Identifier for the data source or venue.
- instrument_id: A canonical identifier for the traded instrument.
- price: Last traded price or mid-price, depending on source.
- size: Trade size or quote size associated with the event.
- best_bid/ask: Current best bid and ask quotes when applicable.
- exchange: Venue or venue code where the event originated.
- sequence: A monotonically increasing sequence number to help with ordering.
- quality_flags: Flags indicating data quality concerns (e.g., late, out-of-order, missing fields).
- metadata: Optional payload with additional context (market session, tariffs, announcements, etc.).

A sample event (JSON) might look like:
{
  "event_time": "2025-08-12T14:31:22.123Z",
  "source": "ExchangeA",
  "instrument_id": "AAPL",
  "price": 184.37,
  "size": 1250,
  "best_bid": 184.35,
  "best_ask": 184.39,
  "exchange": "XTA",
  "sequence": 987654321,
  "quality_flags": ["on-time"],
  "metadata": {"session": "open"}
}

Ingestion Pipeline
- Connection to data sources is abstracted behind adapters. Adapters translate diverse formats into a common event schema.
- Fractured queues ensure that latency spikes in one data stream do not stall others.
- Buffering strategies balance memory usage with the need for smooth downstream processing.
- A robust error handling path routes problematic events to a dead-letter queue with rich diagnostics.

Processing Engine
- The real-time engine subscribes to ingestion events, computes risk signals, and enriches events with derived metrics.
- It supports pluggable calculation modules so teams can tailor risk models to their domain.
- Feature extraction helps downstream analytics by providing precomputed indicators.
- The engine maintains strict ordering within each fractured stream where it matters and uses time-based windows for aggregations.

Historical Replay
- Replay is designed to be deterministic, allowing exact replication of past sessions given the same seed data.
- You can control the replay rate and pause, rewind, or fast-forward as needed.
- Replay supports scenario injection, enabling you to test how strategies would perform under known events, such as flash crashes or news events.

Real-Time Risk Surveillance
- The surveillance layer tracks risk metrics such as exposure, VaR proxies, liquidity risk, and concentration risk.
- It raises alerts when metrics exceed predefined thresholds.
- Dashboards and dashboards-like surfaces present risk status in near real time.

Tick-Level Insight Optimizer
- The optimizer turns raw tick data into actionable signals.
- It prioritizes signals by expected risk impact and data quality.
- It supports experimentation workflows to compare different optimization strategies.

Storage and Persistence
- Event data and derived signals are stored for auditing and replays.
- Time-series databases or event stores preserve history with efficient query capabilities.
- Retention policies balance storage cost with the need for long-term traceability.

Configuration and Deployment
- MarketData uses configuration as code. Parameters live in environment variables, YAML/JSON files, or secret stores.
- The system supports multiple deployment patterns: local development, on-prem clusters, and cloud-native installations.
- Docker and Kubernetes are recommended for most teams, with straightforward paths for scaling and resilience.
